htpasswd-generator
==================

PHP script that generates an htpasswd file.

Wrote this because I wanted to generate an htpasswd file for lighttpd, and the `htpasswd` tool seems to only be included with Apache.

See [`htpasswd-generator.php`](htpasswd-generator.php) for more information on how to use this script and the `cryptPassToFile()` function.
